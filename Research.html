  <li><strong>Job Market Paper:</strong> The Effects of Extended Medicaid Postpartum Coverage on Insurance and Mental Health Outcomes.<br>
    <i>With Sankar Mukhopadhyay</i>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <table style="width:100%; border-collapse:collapse;">
      <tr>
        <td style="width:60%; vertical-align:top; padding-right:15px;">
          Despite the United States' high healthcare expenditure, maternal outcomes remain significantly worse compared 
          to other developed nations. The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 aimed to address this issue by allowing 
          states to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage from 60 days to 12 months. In an era dominated by sharp partisan 
          differences, most states moved quickly to adopt this extension. This paper evaluates the effects of this policy 
          change using high-frequency data from the Household Pulse Survey and a staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD) 
          framework. Our findings indicate that the postpartum coverage expansion significantly increased Medicaid enrollment 
          and reduced uninsurance rates among women of childbearing age. Additionally, the policy led to notable reductions in 
          moderate to severe anxiety and depression, highlighting its positive impact on maternal mental health. The results 
          underscore the importance of continuous health insurance coverage in improving maternal mental health.

  <li><strong>The Effects of Debt Relief on the Mental Health of Farmers.</strong><br>
    <i>With Sankar Mukhopadhyay</i>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <table style="width:100%; border-collapse:collapse;">
      <tr>
        <td style="width:100%; vertical-align:top;">
          We use the quasi-exogenous variation from the farm debt relief programs established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 
          to estimate the effect of debt relief on the mental health outcomes of farmers in the U.S. Using high-frequency (monthly), 
          nationally representative data from the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and difference-in-differences regressions, we find that 
          the IRA debt relief programs improved mental health among farmers. Our preferred estimates suggest that anxiety decreased by 
          9.5% and depression by 9.0%. These effects are stronger among minority farmers: anxiety decreased by 25.2%, and depression 
          decreased by 28.0%. These results suggest that IRA debt relief had a positive and meaningful impact on farmers’ mental health, 
          especially among minority farmers.

  <li><strong>Impact of Negative Life Events on Financial Risk Taking.</strong><br>
    <i>With Federico Guerrero</i>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <table style="width:100%; border-collapse:collapse;">
      <tr>
        <td style="width:60%; vertical-align:top; padding-right:15px;">
          This paper investigates whether traumatic life events—specifically, the loss of a child—shape individuals’ willingness to 
          engage in financial risk-taking. Using data from the 2004–2016 waves of the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we proxy 
          risk preferences through observed portfolio decisions, focusing primarily on stock market participation as an indicator of 
          financial risk-taking behavior. Our analysis reveals that individuals who have experienced the death of a child are less 
          likely to invest in risky assets, suggesting the presence of a negative association between bereavement and financial 
          risk-taking. However, while the evidence points to a potential correlation, the relationship is not statistically definitive. 
          These findings contribute to the broader literature on how deeply personal and emotionally significant life shocks can 
          influence economic decision-making.
