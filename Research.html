    1. Job Market Paper: The Effects of Extended Medicaid Postpartum Coverage on Insurance and Mental Health Outcomes
  </div>
  <i>With Sankar Mukhopadhyay</i>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style="width:60%; padding-right:15px;">
        Despite the United States' high healthcare expenditure, maternal outcomes remain 
significantly worse compared to other developed nations. The American Rescue Plan Act 
(ARPA) of 2021 aimed to address this issue by allowing states to extend Medicaid postpartum 
coverage from 60 days to 12 months. In an era dominated by sharp differences and party 
ideology, most red and blue states moved quickly to adopt this extension. This paper evaluates 
the effects of this policy change using high-frequency data from the Household Pulse Survey and 
a staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework. Our findings indicate that the 
postpartum coverage expansion significantly increased Medicaid enrollment and reduced 
uninsurance rates among women of childbearing age. Additionally, the policy led to notable 
reductions in moderate to severe anxiety and depression, highlighting its positive impact on 
maternal mental health. The results underscore the importance of continuous health insurance 
coverage in improving maternal mental health.

    2. The Effects of Debt Relief on the Mental Health of Farmers
  </div>
  <i>With Sankar Mukhopadhyay</i>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>

  Using quasi-exogenous variation from the farm debt relief programs created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), 
  we estimate the effect of debt relief on the mental health of U.S. farmers. Using monthly, nationally representative 
  data from the Household Pulse Survey and difference-in-differences regressions, we find that IRA debt relief improved 
  farmers' mental health: anxiety decreased by 9.5% and depression by 9.0%. Effects were substantially larger among 
  minority farmers, with anxiety falling by 25.2% and depression by 28.0%. These findings highlight the important role 
  of financial relief in improving mental health outcomes.

    3. Impact of Negative Life Events on Financial Risk Taking
  </div>
  <i>With Federico Guerrero</i>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style="width:60%; padding-right:15px;">
        This paper investigates whether traumatic life events—specifically, the loss of a child—shape individuals’ 
        willingness to engage in financial risk-taking. Using data from the 2004–2016 waves of the Health and Retirement 
        Study (HRS), we proxy risk preferences through portfolio choices, focusing on stock market participation. 
        Individuals who have experienced the death of a child are less likely to invest in risky assets, suggesting a 
        negative association between bereavement and financial risk-taking, although the effect is not statistically 
        definitive.
