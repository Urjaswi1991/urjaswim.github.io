    I did one of the best jobs in an economics class because of her specifically."

    "The course would normally be a more difficult course regarding mathematics and utilizing formulas.
    As a whole, the course taught me important subjects that I would need to utilize in the future if I continued with a future in Finance.
    With Professor Mukherjee, she only had strengths for this course that allowed us to succeed and I wouldn’t say there would be any need for improvement."
